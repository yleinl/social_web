""True"" libertarians in that sense, rather than the anarcho-libertarians, have way more in common with american liberalism than most people expect.

American liberals tend to like the idea of using government to protect and enable individual freedoms, while libertarians think that the individual is responsible for protecting their own freedom, with guns or money or whatever.

They both like the idea of protecting individual freedom as a whole, while republicans are only interested in protecting WASPs at the cost of everybody else. Republicans fool people into thinking they're protecting america as a whole, because sometimes the interests of WASPs align with everybody else, but if there's ever a conflict, they protect WASPs first.",Chase Oliver,Libertarian,77,4,0

That's what kills me when 2nd amendment nuts start bellyaching about the government's ""monopoly on violence"".

I can only respond, ""ok wingus and dingus, what's the alternative? an open market on violence?""

Terrifyingly a lot of them like that idea, because in their monochromatic philosophy, violence is power, and they want power, so they need more access to violence.

That's why they hate regulations that they think can block them from making absolutely the most money possible. Monochromatic philosophy, they thinking money is power, government is bad because they would be marginally richer without it.

- wants an ‚ÄúEllis Island‚Äù approach to immigration where is someone‚Äôs papers are in order they can be quickly processed and given residency status. 

- thinks the private business marketplace will step up to deal with climate change on its own without the need for federal regulation

- thinks the US should encourage immigration from Ukraine and Russia and says that mass immigration from Russia could lower morale for their war.

- wants to eliminate public education.

- wants to end drug possession criminalization

- wants abortions to be legalized at a federal level but doesn‚Äôt want federal funds helping pay for them.


Personally I think he‚Äôs a bit naive when it comes to his notion that private enterprise is literally always the best solution for national problems, but I also agree with his immigration and drug possession stance and his stance on gay rights.

l5u2w5j,notyogrannysgrandkid,2024-05-27 05:18:23,"For anyone interested, the Libertarian nominee is Chase Oliver, whose key positions are as follows:

Abortion

Oliver self-identifies as pro-choice, although he is opposed to taxpayer funding of abortions. He believes that abortion should be legal nationwide, and he has said he would support legislation to make it so.

Climate change

Oliver supports a free market solution to climate change. He contends that if businesses are left alone, they will be incentivized to develop technologies that will eventually replace current carbon-based fuels.

Electoral reform

Oliver is a strong supporter of ranked-choice voting in the United States, which he has said would have prevented the 2022 U.S. Senate election in Georgia from going to a run-off by allowing voters to rank their preferred candidates when they voted the first time. He has also stated that ranked-choice voting would save millions of taxpayer dollars by allowing run-offs to be instant, while ensuring that winning candidates always get above 50% of the vote.

Gun rights

During a 2022 debate with Warnock, Oliver expressed his support for gun rights, stating: ""Armed gays are harder to oppress, and they're harder to bash.""

War on drugs

Oliver advocates for ending the war on drugs, and supports the legalization of marijuana.

Police reform

Oliver supports ending qualified immunity for law enforcement at the federal level.

Immigration

Oliver supports an ""Ellis Island-style immigration"" system, stating: ""If you're coming here to work and be peaceful, it's not my business.""

Education

Oliver supports abolishing the United States Department of Education, and advocates ""for more choice in the education marketplace on a state-by-state basis"".

Homelessness

Oliver supports removing regulatory barriers that prevent people and organizations from feeding people experiencing homelessness.

Third-parties

Oliver was a contributing author in the September 23, 2023 article ""Do Third Parties Help or Harm Democracy?"", published by the nonprofit news organization Divided We Fall. In the article, Oliver discussed the strategic position the Libertarian Party holds for the 2024 election season, third-party ballot access, and how the Libertarian Party platform parallels important issues of other third-party platforms, namely the Green Party of the United States and Forward Party (United States), such as ranked choice voting, immigration, cannabis legalization, and LGBTQ+ rights.",Chase Oliver,Libertarian,40,6,0

Chase Oliver, who was the Libertarian nominee for one of the Georgia senate seats in 2020. He‚Äôs why there was a runoff, which is why the Democrats won that seat and we had a tied Senate. Quite moderate as libertarians go.

*BUT*, last I checked, he hasn‚Äôt won the nomination yet. He was four votes short of a majority of the delegates after Round 6, which eliminated the preferred candidate of the alt-right Mises Caucus: Michael Rectenwald. Round 7 is between Oliver and None of the Above (NOTA); if Rectenwald and the MC decide to flip the board by voting NOTA, there won‚Äôt *be* a presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party.

What do you say to those of us who would have our lives quite literally turned upside down by a Trump presidency? And how will you justify your blatantly obvious actions to ""punish Dems"" when the punishment extends to marginalized communities?

For example, I am transgender, in a red state, and I briefly lost access to my trans-related healthcare because a GOP Attorney General came for our healthcare in my state via consumer protection laws. I am being very serious when I say I had conversations with my doctor that went ""I'm not sure I will legally be able to provide you HRT soon."" 12 years of life-saving, gender-affirming care that could, and likely would, be stripped away federally by a GOP administration. Or at least state wide by a much more empowered red state GOP AG. Biden's DOJ, the ACLU, and other advocacy groups stepped in last time to assist, thank goodness.
 
So what will you say to all the minority communities that would be so greatly and horribly impacted by a Trump administration? He's not being very secretive on who he's targeting, so pick a marginalized community and he's ready to fight them.

On August 7th, you uploaded a video on your Facebook and Instagram accounts where you say ""we are fighting a proxy war"" in regards to Ukraine and in a July 2015 interview you suggested NATO ""pursued a policy of basically encircling Russia,"" implying that this is what prompted Putin and Russia to go on the offensive in Ukraine. It's also said on your campaign website we must ""stop fueling the war between Russia and Ukraine and lead on negotiating a peaceful end"" despite making no mention of the Russian militaries human rights abuses or Putin's goal of territorial annexation. This is a view that incorporates a ""realist"" interpretation on foreign relations.

In the same interview, you said the United States needs ""to stop arming and funding governments committing war crimes and violating human rights"" in regards to countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia and on your campaign website  it mentioned the United States must ""end all military aid to Israel and adopt sanctions until Israel complies with international law to put an end to decades of violence, illegal occupation, displacement, dispossession, apartheid, and ethnic cleansing"" due to Israel's horrifically cruel treatment towards Palestinian lives in Gaza and the West Bank.
